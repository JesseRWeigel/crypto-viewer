This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Overview

I challenged myself to complete the project in only a few hours. Because of this I have focused mainly on functionality and not on style. Given more time, I would make the following updates:

- Add proper styling (I think a dark theme would be nice)
- Use correct types for api data. The json data is quite large, so it would take some time to make correct type interfaces for this.
- Separate the app into components. Since the app is small, everything is the index.tsx file.
- Move inline styles into anoter file.
- Add pages with additional data for each asset.
- Create tests, probably with Cypress
